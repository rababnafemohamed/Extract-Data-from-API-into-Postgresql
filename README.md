## **Extracting Data from the API**  

I have created a **Databricks** job pipeline to run **notebooks in parallel** to load data from the API in **JSON format**. The JSON data was then formatted into a readable **DataFrame**.

I removed **duplicate values** but decided **not to remove all missing values**, as this could affect the final analysis. Additionally, I **renamed columns** for better readability, created **tables in a PostgreSQL database**, and built **data models**. 

## **PostgreSQL**  

- I created a **PostgreSQL database** in the **AWS cloud** and configured **EC2 VPC security groups** with the necessary **inbound and outbound network settings** to enable connections from the **Databricks workspace**.  
- I then **utilized pgAdmin4** to manage the PostgreSQL database.

Finally, I **performed data analysis** using **Google Analytics** to answer the following questions:  
- **How many deals became customers?**

- **What are the top 5 selling brands for each province?**
